//You can provide a type annotation when you declare a constant or variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable can store.
//If you provide an initial value for a constant or variable at the point that it’s defined, Swift can almost always infer the type to be used for that constant or variable.

var welcomeMessage: String = "Bem-Vindo!"
var notas: Double = 8.5
let pi = 3.14 //Tipo definido de forma implícita
