/*Swift uses string interpolation to include the name of a constant or variable as a placeholder in a longer string,
and to prompt Swift to replace it with the current value of that constant or variable. */

var nome = "Thalita"
print("Olá \(nome), Bem vinda!! ")
// Prints "Olá Thalita, Bem vinda!!"
